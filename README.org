* About

My blog written in Elm and Elm UI. My blog posts are available [[https://github.com/jakub-stastny/data.blog][here]].

* Tasks
** TODO Tangle on save in Emacs

Just like the =init.org= file.

For now just use the =watch= function (=bin/watcher.ts=).

** TODO See why the header tangle property is not being respected
